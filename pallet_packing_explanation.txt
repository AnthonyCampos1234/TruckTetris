Intelligent Pallet Packing System Explanation
==========================================

1. Core Components
-----------------
- Rectangle: Base class for dimensions and properties (weight, stackability, product type)
- PlacedRectangle: Extends Rectangle with position, rotation, and stacking information
- TruckLoadOptimizer: Main class handling intelligent packing logic
- LoadingConstraints: Enum defining safety and practical constraints
- Configuration: Separate config files for truck specs and product rules

2. The Intelligent Packing Approach
--------------------------------
The algorithm uses a combination of strategies:
a) Skyline Strategy:
   - Maintains profile of placed pallets
   - Optimizes for lowest possible position
   - Updates dynamically with new placements

b) Weight Distribution:
   - Tracks front/back weight ratio
   - Maintains 60% weight in front half
   - Prevents truck tipping
   - Monitors total weight limits

c) Safety Constraints:
   - Maintains tail clearance (8-10 inches)
   - Ensures side clearance
   - Respects stackability rules
   - Considers product-specific requirements

3. AI-Enhanced Packing Process
---------------------------
a) Initialization:
   - Sets up truck dimensions and weight limits
   - Initializes tracking for weight distribution
   - Establishes safety clearances

b) For each pallet:
   1. AI-driven sorting based on:
      - Physical dimensions
      - Weight considerations
      - Stackability
      - Product type constraints
   
   2. Optimal placement considering:
      - Weight distribution
      - Space efficiency
      - Loading sequence
      - Safety requirements

  * n = number of pallets
  * m = number of skyline positions
- AI optimization: O(n log n) for smart sorting

Space Complexity:
- O(m) for skyline storage
- O(n) for placed pallets tracking
- O(1) for weight distribution tracking

8. Configuration Management
------------------------
TruckConfig:
