Intelligent Pallet Packing System Explanation
==========================================

1. Core Components
-----------------
- Rectangle: Base class for dimensions and properties (weight, stackability, product type, overhang)
- PlacedRectangle: Extends Rectangle with position, rotation, and overhang information
- TruckLoadOptimizer: Main class handling intelligent packing logic
- LoadingConstraints: Enum defining safety and practical constraints
- Visualization: ASCII-based 2D representation of truck loading pattern

2. The Intelligent Packing Approach
--------------------------------
The algorithm uses a combination of strategies:
a) Skyline Strategy:
   - Maintains profile of placed pallets
   - Optimizes for lowest possible position
   - Updates dynamically with new placements
   - Accounts for overhang in placement decisions

b) Weight Distribution:
   - Tracks front/back weight ratio
   - Maintains 60% weight in front half
   - Prevents truck tipping
   - Monitors total weight limits

c) Safety Constraints:
   - Maintains tail clearance (10 inches)
   - Ensures side clearance (2 inches)
   - Handles overhang on one or both sides
   - Respects stackability rules

3. Overhang Handling
------------------
a) Configuration:
   - Overhang amount in inches
   - Single-side or both-sides overhang
   - Adjustment of effective pallet width

b) Placement Logic:
   - Considers total width including overhang
   - Maintains proper spacing between pallets
   - Adjusts x-position for both-sides overhang
   - Visualizes overhang with '>' markers

4. Visualization System
--------------------
a) ASCII-based representation:
   - Box-drawing characters for pallet borders (└┘┌┐─│)
   - Overhang indicators (>)
   - Scale factor of 8 inches per cell
   - Clear distinction between pallets
   - Front-to-back orientation

b) Display Features:
   - Truck boundaries
   - Individual pallet outlines
   - Overhang markers
   - Loading direction indicator
   - Scale information

5. Key Methods
-------------
find_lowest_position():
- Handles overhang in width calculations
- Considers clearance constraints
- Checks weight distribution
- Returns optimal coordinates

pack_pallet():
- Attempts non-rotated placement first
- Considers rotation if needed
- Updates weight tracking
- Maintains overhang information

create_truck_visualization():
- Generates ASCII representation
- Scales dimensions appropriately
- Draws pallet borders
- Shows overhang markers

6. Safety and Practical Considerations
----------------------------------
- Tail clearance enforcement (10 inches)
- Side clearance requirements (2 inches)
- Weight distribution rules (60% front)
- Overhang limitations and tracking
- Stack height limitations
- Maximum weight monitoring (45000 lbs)

7. Data Structures
---------------
Pallet Properties:
- Dimensions (width x length)
- Weight
- Stackability
- Product type
- Overhang amount
- Overhang configuration

Placement Information:
- Coordinates (x, y)
- Rotation status
- Stack height
- Overhang details

8. Usage Example
--------------
- Initialize TruckLoadOptimizer with dimensions
- Define pallets with properties:
  * Dimensions
  * Weight
  * Product type
  * Stackability
  * Overhang amount
  * Overhang configuration
- Call pack_pallets() for optimization
- Retrieve placement coordinates and instructions
- Monitor metrics and constraints

9. Future Enhancement Possibilities
--------------------------------
- Machine learning for pattern recognition
- Historical data integration
- Weather/route condition adaptation
- Dynamic constraint adjustment
- Real-time optimization updates
- Multi-truck load balancing
- 3D visualization support
